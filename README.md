"Z0Z_"- is a placeholder, and a Z0Z_tool is at best, a prototype.

# Install an arbitrary package

Try to install a package that doesn't have installation files.
```sh
py -m Z0Z_tools.pipAnything
```

# Z0Z_io

`URLtoPathFilename` might be decent some day.

If you have a lot of spectrograms, `loadSpectrograms` might, well, load them.

# Install this package

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/hunterhogan/Z0Z_tools.git
```
